Plant Disease Recognition - Documentation
1. Introduction
Objective: Develop a deep learning model to accurately recognize and classify plant diseases from leaf images, supporting early diagnosis for improved crop health.
Data Source: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, likely the "Plant Village Dataset," which contains images labeled by disease type for various plant species.
2. Requirements and Dependencies
Dependencies:
TensorFlow: Used for model creation, training, and evaluation.
NumPy: Manages array operations, essential for image processing.
Matplotlib: For visualization of training progress, sample predictions, and evaluation metrics.
Pandas: Optional for handling any tabular data in preprocessing.
Setup: Ensure all dependencies are installed to avoid compatibility issues when running the notebook.
3. Data Preprocessing
Training Data:

Path Setup: Specifies the directory containing training images, with subdirectories for each disease category.
Image Generator: Uses tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory to batch load and preprocess images with specified parameters (e.g., image size, batch size, shuffling).
Label Mapping: Automatically assigns labels based on the directory structure, supporting multi-class classification.
Validation Data:

Configured similarly to the training data, ensuring uniformity in dimensions and batch sizes for consistent evaluation.
Dataset Performance Optimization:

Prefetching: Configures the dataset to use AUTOTUNE for optimized loading, allowing data to be processed while the model is training, reducing delays.
4. Model Architecture
Architecture Type: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed using the Functional API, chosen over the Sequential model to allow for flexibility and complex connections (e.g., skip connections, branching layers).
Layers:
Convolutional Layers: Extract features such as textures and edges that help differentiate disease types.
Pooling Layers: Downsample feature maps, reducing dimensions and computation.
Regularization Layers: Applies techniques like dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers integrate learned features for the final classification.
Output Layer: Softmax activation produces probabilities for each disease class, enabling multi-class predictions.
Model Function: create_optimized_cnn(input_shape, num_classes): Constructs and returns the CNN using the Functional API, enhancing the model's adaptability to changes in input shape or architecture.
5. Model Compilation
Loss Function: Categorical cross-entropy, well-suited for multi-class classification.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer for efficient and adaptive gradient updates.
Evaluation Metrics:
Precision and Recall: Evaluate the model’s accuracy in correctly identifying diseased plants.
AUC (Area Under Curve): Measures the model’s class distinction capability.
Top K Categorical Accuracy: Tracks whether the correct label appears among the top predictions, useful for difficult-to-classify images.
Model Summary: The Functional API enables a detailed, flexible architecture, viewable with model.summary() for an overview of the model’s layers, shapes, and parameters.
6. Model Training
Callbacks:
Early Stopping: Monitors validation loss to prevent overfitting by halting training if no improvements occur.
Training Process:
Function Call: model.fit(), using parameters for epoch count, training generator, and validation generator.
History Tracking: Records training loss and accuracy for both datasets to analyze learning curves.
7. Training vs. Validation Performance Comparison
Training Metrics:

Accuracy: Reflects the model's performance on the training data.
Loss: Lower training loss indicates better fitting to the training data.
Validation Metrics:

Accuracy: Often slightly lower than training accuracy, indicating the model’s generalization ability.
Loss: Higher validation loss than training loss may indicate overfitting.
Comparison:

Overfitting Indicators: A significant gap between training and validation accuracy, or high validation loss, can suggest overfitting.
Learning Curves: Visualizing training and validation metrics can indicate whether the model is overfitting, underfitting, or learning effectively.
8. Evaluation
Overall Evaluation: Evaluates model performance on both training and validation sets, providing final loss and accuracy scores.
Detailed Metrics: Precision, recall, and AUC further analyze the model’s classification performance, especially on imbalanced data.
9. Testing and Prediction
Single Image Prediction:

Preprocessing: Loads, resizes, and normalizes a single image to match the model's input requirements.
Prediction Output: Displays class probabilities, highlighting the class with the highest predicted probability.
Batch Testing:

Directory Scanning: Loads and preprocesses images from a test directory.
Qualitative Assessment: Visualizes predictions alongside actual labels to gauge model accuracy qualitatively.
10. Visualization
Training History: Plots training and validation accuracy and loss across epochs to visualize learning patterns and diagnose overfitting.
Sample Predictions: Displays predicted labels and true labels for individual test images, allowing for visual confirmation of model predictions.
11. Conclusion
Model Effectiveness: The CNN architecture, created with the Functional API, performs well in identifying plant diseases, with promising accuracy and precision scores.
Recommendations for Improvement:
Model Tuning: Experiment with deeper or transfer learning-based architectures for potentially higher accuracy.
Data Augmentation: Adding more diverse augmentations could enhance generalization, especially for underrepresented classes.
Cross-validation: Useful for further validating the model’s consistency, particularly with expanded datasets.
